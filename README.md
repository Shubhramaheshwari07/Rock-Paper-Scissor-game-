The user can choose between Rock, Paper, and Scissors
The computer's choice is generated randomly
The game displays the result of each round, including the computer's choice and the winner
The user can quit the game at any time

Code Structure:
The code for this project is organized into a single file, rock_paper_scissors.py, which contains the main game logic and implementation.

How to Run the Game:
To run the game, simply execute the rock_paper_scissors.py file using Python
python rock_paper_scissors.py
This will start a new game, and you can play by clicking on the Rock, Paper, or Scissors buttons.
